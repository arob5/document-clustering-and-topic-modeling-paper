The files in this submission implement NMF and SVD, along with error and matrix compression functions

FILES
- Main.scala -
This file utilizes NMF.scala and SVD.scala to obtain low-rank approximations of the term-document matrix.

- NMF.scala -
Contains a standard implementation of the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

- SVD.scala- 
Contains an implementation of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as well as functionality to
compress an input data matrix  

- KMeans.scala-
Contains implementation of k-means algorithm to cluster documents. Documents assumed to be in the columns
of input matrix

-Evaluation.scala-
Contains the functionality to evaluate the matrix approximations using the relative Frobenius Norm

RUNNING CODE
While in the folder with all of these files, run “sbt compile” followed by “sbt -J-Xmx2g run” in the command line
The data will be loaded from the CSV file contained in the folder (see paper for details on the data)

ANALYSIS
Analysis conducted on the dataset utilizing these files is documented in the paper 
“Algorithm Comparison for Document Clustering and Topic Modeling”; Details on methods and the dataset are
contained there.
